"""Claude Code PreToolUse hook for the ohpcc-nmbu skill — defense in depth.

The wrappers confine writes to HPC_REMOTE_ROOT and never delete, but an agent
could bypass them by running raw `ssh <host> 'rm -rf ...'` or `rsync --delete`
directly. This hook inspects each Bash command and BLOCKS (exit code 2) the
clearly destructive ones that target the configured cluster, turning the
safety.md rules from "the agent should" into "the harness won't let it".

Scope is deliberately narrow to avoid false positives:
  * It does nothing unless an hpc.env is found (so it only acts in projects that
    use this skill) and the command references that project's HPC_HOST.
  * It only inspects ssh/rsync/scp commands — local commands are never touched.
  * It blocks rsync --delete and a short list of high-harm remote operations
    (recursive/forced rm, mkfs, dd of=, fork bombs, recursive chmod/chown,
    redirects into system paths). Normal wrapper calls and reads pass through.

Enable it by adding a PreToolUse hook to settings.json (see SKILL.md /
reference/safety.md). It is best-effort: on any internal error it fails open
(exit 0) so a hook bug can never wedge your shell — the hardened wrappers remain
the primary safeguard.
